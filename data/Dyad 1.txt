C: This is icat consultant 740, today is the 30th of November.  And this is we’re discussing the second IA.
C: Okay so just to recap for a moment. The first IA kind of the [umm] initial description of the concern that we have; one of them that we had was language and prior knowledge but maybe he was kind of getting sleepy here or something like that.  When it comes to his writing it’s kind of incomprehensible.  It’s kind of rough to tell.  [Umm] another one we’ve had was word recognition and meaning. He didn’t have sufficient knowledge of sight words.  Then another one we had was responding and he did better when he was listening to it like on a tape [teacher says, yeah] or listening to us read [teacher says, yeah].  He was able to respond better.  And he we had to go to a lot of aided questions to get it out of him.  OK so after yesterday, is there going by the stars anything different or anything you think or any concerns you have from yesterday?
T: [Umm] one thing I thought from yesterday [uh] kind of relating to to word recognition and meaning.  He seems to have very good processes for trying words out; it’s just like a matter of time.  [You know] when you’re actually reading something in the home and you’re not in a classroom setting you don’t have time to go through the processes but it sounds like he’s very intelligent and very kind of intuitive. [You know, uh] he can reason it out in the normal setting but he just doesn’t have time [consultant says, yeah] to do that and I imagine the frustration comes pretty quickly.  [You know] it’s like when playing a game you just don’t have enough time to meet each deadline. You know how that is [consultant laughs]. [You know] it’s, so it’s you know with him it’s it’s the ability is there, just the the environment is what is the problem. That’s the problem [consultant says, okay].  So, which I guess as we move on from last weeks as we learned from last week it being the problem [consultant says, okay]. [Umm] maybe not at a high enough level to be able to pick up processes as quickly as necessary but the processes are certainly there [consultant says, okay].
C: [Umm] so, I’m just going to recap what you said to make sure I understood.  So this guy has the skills and he has the ability to do things but it takes him a little longer [teachers says, yeah] and so that would get frustrating because you know he would fall behind [teacher says, yeah] and that would be frustrating [teacher says, yeah].  Okay, so I just have written down that he has the skills but that it takes him a long time 
T: And he remains reluctant to ask for things in class [consultant says, okay] and never asks questions in class. 
C: [writing] Okay
C: [Umm] so did anything, any of the ones that we had written down before, so we have the language, prior knowledge, word recognition, and responding; did any of those kind of stand out more this time, from last time, to kind of narrow it down? We’ll try to, What we’ll try to do is narrow this down to one of them that we’ll work on.
T: [Uh] I would, I I guess word recognition [consultant says, okay] because I was going to say, like with a lot of them you would ask him specifically he was never very fluent with any of them with time being the issue. So, I guess just generally.
C: That’s kind of what I was thinking too.
T: Yeah
C: I knew in some way that it was the word recognition [teacher says, yeah]. [And umm] we kind of discussed yesterday but he doesn’t really have the sufficient word rec. He kind of, he knew some of them but he didn’t have enough sight words, enough vocabulary [teacher says, yeah] to even talk about what 
T: Yeah, it to me it equates to [you know] taking a entry level foreign language where your learning basic, general, broad vocabulary and you don’t know any of the words [consultant says, yeah].  I think it’s like that. [Umm] a good example was state trooper [you know], [consultant says, yeah] I wasn’t sure if he would even know what it means and that but state trooper [he didn’t know what state trooper was until] was the specifics, so [consultant says, umm… okay]

C: For now I think we’re probably good.  We’ll focus. We’ll do one more IA and see if it still remains that or if something else just kind of jumps out at us; but as of right now that’s what’s kind of jumped out to me both times [teacher says, yeah] is the word recognition is an issue.  Because I mean I think that will affect his responding.  That’s going to help him out in being more fluent [teacher says, yeah] and he might be able to respond better so. [Umm] I feel that’s the main thing.  Is there anything else that you saw or?
T: [Umm] adjusted he seems like eager to get in and seems like very pleasant, very polite and he strikes me as the kind of kid who wants to do as well as he can in a difficult situation.  [Umm] he’s never struck me as lazy or anything [you know] like that. [Uh] He seems to have, he tries to engage, he does the best he can with what he knows, he just doesn’t ever ask for help with things that he struggles with and that’s the part that kind of worries me just trying to figure it all out on his own and struggling with it on his own.  That’s not the best way to find success [consultant says, yeah] and [uh] so he’s struggling.
C: And I would agree
T: and I would worry about him too [you know] when you look at, when you look at this specific class, well we’re looking at fairly general vocab with [you know] reading the average story [consultant says, mmhmm].  It sort of makes you worry about him in something [consultant says, in all these] like science class [consultant says, mmm yeah in all the other classes] where it’s subject specific, so [consultant says, mmhmm]. 
T: Jargon
C: Yeah. Some jargon he might be struggling with. 
T: Yeah, that would be difficult.  I don’t even know how you would do that to tell you the truth. It would be complicated enough with what we’re doing in class. 
C: Yeah, that’s got to be complicated
T: Yeah
C: well, so I think we’ll focus on that for now. We’ll do one more IA. [Umm] so we’ll shoot for next week maybe [uh] does the block day work all right to do one more IA [teacher says, yeah]?  So next Thursday again?  
T: although, I mean, the only the only reluctance I would have there would be from this point [consultant says, I know, pulling him out of that same class] we would be pulling him out of that block period [consultant says, mmhmm]. I don’t know [consultant says, yeah], maybe, I don’t know that’s what I worry about there.  
C: Yeah, that’s true.  
T: But it works for me during my class
C: Okay
C: Well, I don’t want you to have to do it all. [consultant laughs]
T: Well, I mean I I’m flexible with any time you can do it.  I just, like we talked about yesterday, I worry about just pulling him out [mmhmm] of one class 
C: Exactly
T: It just seems counterproductive
C: Yeah, kind of wish that we could kind of abduct him in here
T: [teacher laughs] Yeah
C: Pull him in here. Okay, well we’ll shoot for next week, next Thursday and see if [uh], if we could have, what I’ve been doing is having Anne cover my class for a little while [teacher says, oh yeah?] she sits in there while they go on with whatever they’re doing.  So if we want to switch periods or something she could jump into your class and we can do it.
T: yeah, yeah we can do that.  [Umm] I guess, we should just talk to Alassandra and ask [consultant says, and see about, ask about it] about it. Because [and uh] and I think that would be good from an angle as well of, [you know] like I think we talked about yesterday, I worry because he’s not quite sure what’s going on [consultant says, mmhmm] and how can I create meaningful value out of this class. 
C: Yeah
T: So, sort of [uh, you know] nobody really even asked him if he wanted to be taken out of this class all the time [consultant says, yeah].  So I worry about that.
C: We’ll talk to her and see if he can be pulled out of his Spanish class [teacher says, yeah].  I’ll go talk to her to see [teacher says, yeah] what she thinks.  If we could pull him out of that, that’s my third hour through study hall and they’re pretty good to go during that. 
T: my third hour is a nightmare. 
C: never mind then, never mind [consultant and teacher laugh]
T: any other period I would give less than a whistle but my third period I need to be there.
C: the only other ones I can think of are maybe fourth or [stops to think] really I think I can only do it first, fourth, or seventh, if any of those would work. First is my reading class.
T: In seventh there will be a time [uh] next week when I’ll be showing the film How To Kill A	 Mockingbird right at first through the seventh so that would be a good time for me [consultant says, OK] to set aside to do this [consultant says, OK].  [Umm] So I would say starting around, I’m not going to be able to get started until Tuesday or Thursday [consultant says, OK] so. 
C: okay, So maybe if we start, I’ll be gone Friday for basketball [teacher says, oh ok] maybe Thursday?  
T: first or seventh?
C: first or seventh, yeah.  Well, I’ll look at his schedule and see if we can make that happen.
T: Okay.
C: Okay, sounds good.
