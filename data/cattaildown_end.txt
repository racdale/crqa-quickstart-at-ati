headed east out of st. paul,
we stopped for water.
rested in the cemetery,
watched the mississippi.
running out of food stamps,
found a bag along the footpath
off highway 61 filled with
what looked like marijuana.
(don't worry mom, we left it there)
hopped a grainrail out of pig's eye
toward milwaukee, a deer
between the tower and the tracks,
saw right through us.
said, "you don't know where you came from,
you don't know where you're going,
you think you're you-
you don't know who you are,
you're not you.
you're everyone else.
you're everyone else.
you're everyone else.
you're everyone else.
you're everyone else.
you're everyone else.
you're everyone else.
you're everyone else.
you're everyone else.
you're everyone else.
you're everyone else.
